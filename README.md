# Graduation Planner


<a id="orga752e3e"></a>

## What is this project?

The purpose of this project is to create a versatile "Graduation Degree Plan"
for college students. Many times it can be overwhelming understanding the
requirements to graduate. So this template is meant to be a place to place all
this information.


<a id="org894cebf"></a>

## Why create this template?

I am a returning college student and when I first graduated college I felt glad it
was over. But later on I felt bummed because I could have done better. I was a
bit disorganized with my degree plan and for that reason I created this
template.


<a id="orgb838d7f"></a>

## Getting Started

These are the mininum requirements.

-   `Emacs 25+`
-   `Org-mode`

Optional packages

-   `pandoc`
-   `texlive`
-   `Reveal JS`

## Installing

Simply download the zip archive of this repository and unzip it to your local filesystem.

Setup your `org-mode` targets by either adding **Graduation Planner** to your
`org-mode` setting or make **Graduation Planner** your `org-agenda`.

-   Org Directory
    `setq org-directory "/path/to/graduationplanner"`

-   Org Agenda
    `setq org-agenda-files ("/path/to/graduationplanner/school.org")`

## What can I do with this template?

You can keep track of important information such as a copy of your degree plan,
important dates, and your course schedule. Other bits of information you can
keep track are financial aid information, books, software purchases.

        important dates, books, software.
