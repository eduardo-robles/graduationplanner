# Graduation Planner


<a id="org8f61bee"></a>

## What is this project?

The purpose of this project is to create a versatile "Graduation Degree Plan"
for college students. Many times it can be overwhelming understanding the
requirements to graduate. So this template is meant to be a place to place all
this information.


<a id="orga1389ac"></a>

## Why create this template?

I am a returning college student and when I first graduated college I felt glad it
was over. But later on I felt bummed because I could have done better. I was a
bit disorganized with my degree plan and for that reason I created this
template.


<a id="org6f4e13b"></a>

## Getting Started

These are the mininum requirements.

-   `Emacs 25+`
-   `Org-mode`

Optional packages

-   `pandoc`
-   `texlive`
-   `Reveal JS`

## Installing

Simply download the zip archive of this repository and unzip it to your local
`emacs` environment.

Setup your `org-mode` targets by either adding **Graduation Planner** to your
`org-mode` setting or make **Graduation Planner** your `org-agenda`.

    `setq org-directory "/path/to/graduationplanner"`

## What can I do with this template?

You can keep track of important information such as a copy of your degree plan,
important dates, and your course schedule. Other bits of information you can
keep track are financial aid information, books, software purchases.

        important dates, books, software.
