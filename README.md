# Graduation Degree Plan

<a id="org9e420b6"></a>

## What is this project?

The purpose of this project is to create a versatile "Graduation Degree Plan"
for college students. Many times it can be overwhelming understanding the
requirements to graduate. So this template is meant to be a place to place all
this information.

## Why create this template?

I am a returning college student and when I first graduated college I felt glad it
was over. But later on I felt bummed because I could have done better. I was a
bit disorganized with my degree plan and for that reason I created this
template.

## What can I do with this template?

You can keep track of important information such as a copy of your degree plan,
important dates, and your course schedule. Other bits of information you can
keep track are financial aid information, books, software purchases.

Templates:

1.  School.org
    -   A template to keep track of your courses, credit hours, finacial aid,
        important dates, books, software.
2.  Class.org
    -   A template to keep your notes organized per course
3.  Talk.org
    -   A **Reveal JS** template for any presentations you create for a course
4.  Paper.org
    -   A template for any term paper you may write for a class.
